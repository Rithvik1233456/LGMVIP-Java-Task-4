A simple search engine has been developed using the Java programming language. This search engine is likely to include functionalities like indexing and searching through a collection of data. The Java code would handle user queries and perform the search using algorithms like inverted indexing or keyword matching. The search engine's interface may allow users to enter search terms and present the results in a ranked order. While not as sophisticated as commercial search engines, this Java-based search engine serves as an educational or small-scale solution for information retrieval tasks within a defined dataset.
